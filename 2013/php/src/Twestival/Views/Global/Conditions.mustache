								<h3>Event Requirements</h3>
									<p>
										Twestival may provide you with the opportunity to apply with Twestival to list through the Services a global or local event that you organize, host, or otherwise participate in to raise funds for an approved charitable recipient (an “<strong><em>Event</em></strong>”).

At a minimum, the Charitable Recipient must (a) be registered within its jurisdiction as a non-profit organization; (b) not be overtly religious or political; and (c) have transparent funding (including, without limitation, the flow of funding). Although Twestival reserves the right at its sole discretion to approve or reject any prospective Charitable Recipients, prospective Charitable Recipients are often approved by Twestival’s global team if they meet the above requirements, Twestival’s efficiency standards, and the vision of Twestival.
									</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Lead Organizers</h3>

You and Twestival agree: (a) to notify each other of any dispute within 30 days of when it arises and attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, U.S.A.; and (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS (or its successor). The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. Except as expressly provided herein, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law, and the award and determination of the arbitrator will be binding upon the parties and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twestival will not commence against the other a class action, class ARBITRATION, or other representative action or proceeding.

					<h2>No Waiver; Severability</h2>
						<p>
							Enforcement of these Terms is solely at Twestival’s discretion, and failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of Twestival’s right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable (including, without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above) then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
